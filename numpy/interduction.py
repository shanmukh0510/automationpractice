#numpy is a linbrary is used to work with arrys
#It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices
#NumPy stands for Numerical Python

# In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.

# NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.
